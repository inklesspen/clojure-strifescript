# strifescript

This is a webapp designed to handle Mouse Guard's conflict resolution
scheme. It has an unusual system for a RPG; players have to choose
three successive actions, lock them in, and then reveal them one at a
time. Simple at the table, yet hard online.

This was my first attempt at writing a solution, during the summer of
2012. It's not maintained or developed anymore, but you can use it if
you like.

## Usage

If you use cake, substitute 'lein' with 'cake' below. Everything should work fine.

```bash
lein deps
lein run
```
